# ISA - IMAP client with TLS support
Simple IMAP client with TLS support, which allows a user to download all/new
messages/headers from a specified mailbox. IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501) support is
implemented via BSD sockets, for SSL/TLS support the OpenSSL library is used.
All downloaded messages are stored in Interned Message Format (RFC 5322).

## Usage
Usage: ./imapcl server [-p port] [-T [-c certfile] [-C certdir]] [-n] [-h]
                [-a auth_file] [-b MAILBOX] -o out_dir

  server        server IP/domain name
  -p port       server port (default: 143/993 IMAP/IMAPS)
  -T            turn on SSL/TLS
  -c certfile   file with SSL/TLS certificate(s)
  -C certdir    directory with SSL/TLS certificates (default: /etc/ssl/certs)*
  -n            read only new/unread messages
  -h            download only email headers
  -a auth_file  file with user credentials
  -b MAILBOX    target mailbox name (default: INBOX)
  -o out_dir    output directory for downloaded messsages

Example auth_file:

* files in this directory must be named appropriately - see man rehash(1)
