# IPK 2016 - File transfer
## Basic info
This project implements a custom application protocol for file tranfer between
client and server, based on socket API. Structure of the protocol is described
in attached documentation. Both server and client are written in C++.

## Server
Server part is located in file *server.cpp*. Command line syntax is pretty
simple:
    `./server -p 12345`
After exexcuting mentioned command, server will attach itself to port 12345
and will wait for client connections. All file operations are processed in
the current directory, so make sure to not ovewrite important files.

## Client
As one would expect, client part is implemented in file *client.cpp*. Command
line syntax is following:
    `./client -u hostname -p port [-u|-d] filename`
*-u* and *-p* options are self-explanatory. The remaining two options are used
for file upload (*-u*) and download (*-d*). All mentioned options are required, 
but only one of *-u* and *-d* can be specified at the same time.

*hostname* can be specified as a domain name or optionally as an IP address.

*filename* can be any file from current client directory (neither client nor
server support file operations on files from non-current directory).

## Tests
Attached script *test.sh* runs a simple sanity check. Script compiles both
server and client, sets up a working environment, creates a test file for 
upload/download and runs it through both client and server. Resulting file is
then compared againts its original to make sure it wasn't changed during
transport.
